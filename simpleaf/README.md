**Dependencies**

 1. [Termite](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Termite)
 2. [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)
 3. [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
 4. [Compton](https://github.com/tryone144/compton)
 5. [feh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Feh)
 6. Download [this wallpaper](https://i.redd.it/58d98pnf1kb31.png) and put it at **~/Pictures/Wallpapers**. My i3/config assumes that location by default.
 7. i3/Termite Font -> [SF Mono](https://github.com/2players/sfmono-nerd-font)
 8. Bar Font -> [Inconsolata Patched Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/InconsolataGo)

**Installation**
1. Install above dependencies. Find how to deal with fonts [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts) and [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_configuration).
1. Merge the **.config** folder you see above into *your* **.config**. By all means go through it if you want to.
2. Replace all occurences of the word "**kelsnare**" in any paths with your username. There should only be one instance in **.config/i3/config** where I use the program [feh]L(https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Feh) to update the wallpaper.

**Note**: Above method should work on a raw new install. It is however fairly simple otherwise to skim through and use just what you want/need.

Cheers!
